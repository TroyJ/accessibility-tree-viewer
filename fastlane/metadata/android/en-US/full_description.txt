Tree Viewer is a developer tool that uses Android's AccessibilityService to display the UI tree of the current screen as a live overlay.

Features:
- Left-half overlay showing the full accessibility tree with indentation
- Tags for clickable, editable, scrollable, and long-clickable elements
- Text content and content descriptions displayed inline
- Right-half overlay with interactive blocks for clickable elements
- Blocks show color-coded action availability (click/long-click)
- Page up/down navigation for the log view
- Show/hide toggle for the right-side overlay
- Pass-through touch on the log overlay (taps reach the app underneath)
- Auto-refreshes on screen content changes with debounce

Permissions:
- Draw over other apps (SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW) — for the overlay display
- Accessibility Service — to read the UI tree

This app is intended for developers and accessibility testers. It does not collect, store, or transmit any data.
